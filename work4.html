      <p>
        The primary objective of this project is to conceptually design and implement a compact, energy-efficient in-line water heater that delivers hot water instantaneously at the kitchen sink. This system will resolve the users issue by eliminating the wait time needed to heat water, reduce energy consumption, offering hot water on demand for improved convenience, and reduce clutter in kitchen spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        My particular role in this project was to create the 3D CAD design of the entire water heater system with appropriate market and instrument research for the entire system, as well as create the costed bill of materials for this application.
