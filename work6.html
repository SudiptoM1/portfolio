      <p>
        In my manufacturing processes class, one technique I learned about and was tested on was rapid prototyping. Here, I designed an object via CAD software that was supposed to be additively manufactured using the labâ€™s Creality 3D Printers. After the object was printed, I would have to verify my dimensions using my knowledge of GD&T and ensure all the tolerances were within an acceptable range.
