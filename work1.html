      <p>
        My most recent project is my senior design project is one Iâ€™ve worked on with my teammates during the 2024-2025 school year. My group worked closely with Belimo Aircontrols (American Division) in order to support the test engineers at Belimo who were testing valves manually. We streamlined this into an automatic process in order to make their lives easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        The particular test we were tasked to streamline was the critical angle test, which determined the angle at which the ball valve once turned to, would start leaking.
