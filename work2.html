      <p>
        Over the course of the Fall 2024 semester, I’ve participated in the NASA L’SPACE Mission Concept Academy as a thermal engineer, where I demonstrated knowledge by following the NASA mission life cycle, up to submission of a Preliminary Design Review, for a robotic space mission by attending and engaging in weekly lectures taught by NASA scientists, engineers, and managers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I supported the Thermal system design of a rover to carry out the mission’s science objectives, by researching similar mission’s architecture, performing trade studies between subsystem architectures, and completing CAD design of the subsystem by using Siemens NX.

Instructions:

Save as work2.html.

The "Previous" button links back to work1.html.

Uncomment and update the "Next" button when you add a third project.

This keeps your code organized and easy to expand!
